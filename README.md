## Getting Started

**Anyway to host a website**

Tools required:
- Web Browser
- Any method of hosting

What I use for local hosting:
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (text editor of choice)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (for local testing)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/) (web browser of choice)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.com/) (for hosting)
- [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) (for version control)

## How I Host Locally
*I use macOS and Windows 11*

Step 1: Go to [Clone or download](https://github.com/PiSaucer/boredhtml/archive/master.zip)

Step 2: Unzip the repo

Step 3: Keep note where you unzipped at (the directory)

Step 4: Open your Command Prompt, Terminal, etc

Step 5: Go to your directory (where you unzip the files)

Step 6: Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) with npm (or yarn):

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Step 7: Run ```http-server```

Step 8: Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in chrome.

Step 9: Make changes in vscode and push to GitHub.
